        <h2>About Formula 2</h2>
        <p>FIA Formula 2 (F2) is a single-seater motorsport championship. It is considered a feeder series for Formula 1. Many young drivers compete in F2 to show their skills and try to move up to Formula 1.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cars are similar for all teams (spec series) so driver skill matters a lot.</li>
            <li>Races support Formula 1 race weekends at many tracks.</li>
            <li>Drivers often are in their late teens or early twenties.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="how-it-works" class="card">
        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>Each race weekend typically includes practice, qualifying and one or two races. The weekend format helps drivers practice racecraft and race strategy.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Practice:</strong> Drivers test the car and learn the track.</li>
            <li><strong>Qualifying:</strong> Determines the starting order for the main race (the feature race).</li>
            <li><strong>Sprint / Feature races:</strong> Feature race is longer and often awards more points; sprint race is shorter.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="teams" class="card">

            <li>Round 2 — Circuit 2 (City) — Date</li>

    <section id="rules" class="card">
        <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
        <p>F2 has rules to keep competition fair and safe. Here are a few simple points:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All teams use similar chassis and engines (spec series).</li>
            <li>Points are awarded to top finishers; the championship is decided by total points.</li>
            <li>Pit stops and tyre choices can affect race strategy (in the feature race).</li>
            <li>Drivers must follow safety flags and marshals' instructions at all times.</li>
        </ul>
